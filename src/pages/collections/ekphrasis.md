Ekphrasis - writing about art - is a practice as old as ancient Greece. On the one hand it is a celebration of art, on the other a celebration of language. But the truly unique thing the ekphrastic writer brings to the table is a personal reading of ambiguous forms, a meditation on the paradoxes embodied by our perception of art - the timeless rigidity of fixed brushstrokes against subjects caught in the momentary, the eternal idea against the mortal human. Extended, these paradoxes easily speak to the fragility, conceit, passion, and struggles of mankind.  Through ekphrasis, many have contemplated these themes: see _Ode on a Grecian Urn_ by John Keats, _Ozymandias_ by Percy Shelley, Walter Pater's famous interpretation of the _Mona Lisa_, and in book form, the evocation of Poussin's painting in the opening pages of _A Dance to the Music of Time_ by Anthony Powell.

In this collection, we present sketches of art in connection with personal reflections.
