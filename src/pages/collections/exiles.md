The writer James Joyce willingly pursued self exile, but in his writings and his characters, it was to his native Ireland that he looked for inspiration time and again. Reading his works, few can argue that he was less Irish than his compatriot - and patriot - W. B. Yeats. Can we truly be divorced from the circumstances of our birth? From country, ethnicity, even self?

What drives us to exile? What drives us to return? And in between, where do we belong, if at all?
