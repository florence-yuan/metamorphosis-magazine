Greek myths have acquired a mythology all their own, but what about folktales from the East?  Specifically from China?  Whereas many edifices from Greece, Rome, and South America still stand tall, there is a notable divide in China between the past and present, so that when we think of ancient Chinese mythology, we see little more than dragons... and more dragons. So here is a collection of Chinese folktales, many directly taken from the oral tradition, with the requisite dragons (naturally), but also with unscruplous scholars, clever animals, and odds and ends that have been handed down through the generations.

Perhaps most astonishingly, the morals of these stories often echo themes from Western mythology we know and love. Is there really a "collective unconscious", as Carl Jung terms it? We include our own readings, but you're welcome to add yours!
