Flushed pink, the anemone breathes

And somewhere within its tangled arms

A new love is born – of the flower, or of the sea?
<br/><br/>


All tragedy circles back to its beginning

In incorporeal foam and ethereal breath

_She_ is blown to shore
<br/><br/>


With golden hair and marble skin

The greatest power yet will mankind seize

And one shall waft, and one shall clothe

Never yet has there been such equilibrium
<br/><br/>


Oh, divine balance between Man and Lust

The one demands, the other answers

Only the other shall too demand

And nothing is eternal but the journey’s end
<br/><br/>

Dark netherworld under this earth and sea

Ah, grim portent of what is to come

She above the foam and she who reigns below

Divinity beckons and mortal follows
<br/><br/>


Flushed pink, the anemone breathes

And somewhere within its tangled arms

A new tragedy bubbles to shore
