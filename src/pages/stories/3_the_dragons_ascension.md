description: It is easier to become a dragon than to stay one. Oh ye mortals, shed your earthly shame, lest you hit an unexpected snag...

Once there was a scholar who was very ill.  He was diagnosed with fever of the body and brain, but his afflictions were so queer that none could cure him.  Having exhausted all medical avenues, his mother decided to visit a wise man for help.  After consulting the stars and the spirits, the wise man informed her that there was indeed a way to turn about her son’s fortunes: at the next full moon, she must strip him completely naked and lay him on his bed.  When the moonlight shines full through the window, her son will become a dragon and ascend to heaven.

The woman did as she was told.  On the date of the full moon, she proceeded to prepare her son as the wise man had instructed.  Having stripped off all his garments, she hesitated when it came to his underwear.  She decided to leave it be – after all, what problem would a little more dignity pose to her son’s ascension?

Things unfolded exactly as the wise man had predicted.  A little after midnight, the moon emerged from a mist of clouds and rose gently, steadily moving across the sky to align with the sick scholar’s window.

Finally, the moonlight shone full upon his form – naked apart from his underpants.  As his mother watched, her eyes filled with awe, the scholar was transformed into a dragon – a fantastical creature with heavenly dignity and grandeur, majestic beyond mortal imagination.  Now he glided slowly out of the window, scales shimmering under the moonlight…  Now he was ascending, then with a great spurt of speed sped toward the sky…  But just as he was passing the roof, the pair of underpants his mother had neglected to remove caught a small ornamental dragon on the roof – a guardian animal against evil spirits.  For a moment he was suspended midair, then he was crashing down to the ground, the magnificent form writhing and was still.  Dead before he could ascend to heaven, and all because of an unexpected snag.
