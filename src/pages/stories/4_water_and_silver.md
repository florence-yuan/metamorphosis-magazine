description: No doubt water is purer than silver, but even divine providence agrees that the one, but not the other, will be rewarded to the purer of heart.

Night had descended a long time before two weary travelers finally reached an inn.  The service was poor and the rooms bleak, but the barest beds were to the two men a blissful haven, and it was not long before they fell soundly asleep.

Some hours later, one of the travelers woke suddenly, seized by an inexplicable thirst.  He did not wish to wake the innkeeper or his companion, so quietly, he fastened his robes and stole out of the inn in search of water himself.  After a short walk, he was pleased to hear the sound of water.  Soon he came upon a deserted pagoda with long, graceful eaves that hang down like a scholar’s headdress, by then several decades out of fashion.  Figurines of protective spirits stood upon the roofs, cutting jagged shapes into the sky.  The gaping mouth of a dragon glimmered once when the moon emerged briefly from the clouds, and then all was still and quiet.

Bowing his head, the traveler entered humbly, and there at the center of the building he found a well, the sloshing sound of water appearing like music to his ears.  In his state of exhausted bliss he hardly paused to question why a still pool of water should make such a sound at all.  Happily he seized an old wooden bucket sitting on the floor, and with a great heave, lowered it carefully into the well.  After several seconds he pulled it up, only to see that instead of water, the bucket was filled with silver ingots.  Shocked, he accidentally let go of the rope, and the bucket clattered to the bottom of the well.  For a few moments he stared numbly at the well, astonished by the untold riches lying in its depths.  But the traveler was tired, and he wanted to share his find with his companion so that they could retrieve the silver together.

So the traveler returned to the inn.  In his excitement, he woke his companion and informed him of what he’d discovered.  The companion was first astounded, and then ecstatic.  But the first traveler argued that it would be better to wait till morning – after all, the treasure was not going to flee on its own, but they would be in a better state to retrieve and carry it.  The second traveler pretended to agree, but as soon as the first had fallen asleep, he crept out of bed, slipped out of the inn, and began looking for the pagoda with the distinctive eaves.  After some time he managed to find it, and upon entering it he came upon the mysterious well.  Sure enough, it was tinkling merrily with the sound of water.  But was there silver?  Doubtfully, the second traveler lowered the bucket into the well and then pulled it up, and then he leaned in for a closer look…  A bucket of clear water greeted him.  Inwardly, the traveler cursed his friend for what was undoubtedly a joke.  He was, however, a little thirsty.  Shrugging, he tipped the bucket over his mouth and drank until he had satiated his thirst.  Then he returned to the inn.

Just as he was falling asleep, the traveler was struck with a terrible pain in his abdomen.  As much as he tried to suppress his groans, the pain only grew.  Soon it had become intolerable, and he dropped to the floor and rolled around clutching his abdomen, thrashing and moaning in agony.  The first traveler awoke and rushed to his friend’s side, but his attempts to help were in vain.  Suddenly, the second traveler appeared to choke, his throat convulsed and something rippled and bulged under its surface, then with a reflexive gag, he vomited up two shiny ingots, landing neatly on the floor.  When the two had gotten over the shock, the second traveler confessed weakly that he had tried to get the silver for himself.  When his companion insisted that he was forgiven and they should share the silver, he declined sorrowfully and said, “No, the silver is rightfully yours.  It even called out to you with the sound of water.  When you went there you saw the silver, but I could only see water.  You went with the purest motives, while I was motivated by greed.”

The hand of divinity intervenes through miraculous transubstantiation.  Greed will always result in suffering.  These are near-universal lessons in tales worldwide, but different cultures substitude different characters for the omnipresent force that dispenses rewards and punishments for virtues and vices.  Many Chinese folktales are fundamentally atheist, and characters usually interpreted as religious (such as gods, goddesses, officials in the realm of death, etc.) are more comparable to pagan gods.  Oftentimes, even these figures are omitted, in favor of various manifestations of an entity often referred to as "Heaven". In the story above, the manifestation of "Heaven" is an unnamed natural force, which seemingly imbues nature with the power of judgment and morality. This generates a somewhat surrealist atmosphere that is often combined with the grotesque (regurgitation, etc.) that suggests a common-sense, folk-story approach to morality.
