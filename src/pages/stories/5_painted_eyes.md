description: Before the deluge came, the eyes of the stone lion turned scarlet...
---

Once upon a time, there was a village of very selfish people.  They never shared anything with their neighbors, and their hatefulness hang over them like a foul mist.  Enraged by what they witnessed, the gods convened to pass judgment on the villagers, and most were set on exterminating the entire village with a single flood.  One god, however, interjected that a little mercy never went amiss: if there was a single seed of goodness in the entire village, it should be allowed to live, and he would personally see if it existed.  The council of gods agreed, so the god descended to the village in the guise of a beggar.

From end to end of the village he walked, and at each door he paused and knocked.  To every single villager he rasped, “Oh, good lady good sir, for three days I have gone without food and drink.  Please can you spare me a morsel or two?”  But the villagers had not a shred of compassion.  “We do not give food to beggars,” they said bluntly, and slammed the door in the god’s face.

And so the god found himself at the very edge of the village.  But there in the middle of the road he saw an elderly woman kneeling on the ground praying.  Beside her was a small table with a portable wok.  On the table stood two candles of incense, while in the wok rice steamed.  Hot air and incense mingled and rolled heavenward in white wisps.  There was something very touching in the woman’s gesture, and amid all the white mist she appeared almost otherworldly.  The god advanced, limping, and as the woman raised her gaze in the middle of prayer he spoke, “Ah, good lady, I commend you for your piety.  But I have come a long way and I am very hungry.  Please can you spare me a morsel or two?”
“I am praying to the gods,” said the old woman.  “And I have only the rice in this wok as my humble offerings.  I can only spare you a bowl, I’m afraid.  I’m sorry I cannot give you more.”  Thus speaking, she ladled half the rice into a bowl, and offered it to the disguised god.

The god smiled as he took the bowl.  He looked at the old woman again, noting the frank goodness in her face, brown and weathered as it was.  Briefly he glanced back at the grayish village houses that extended into the distance, recalling how each and every door had slammed so cruelly in his face.  His eyes lingered on a large stone lion near the gates of the village.  It was a ferocious looking thing, meant to ward off invisible spirits of evil.  Its eyes were large and rotund, the same hard, gray color as the rest of its body and indeed, the rest of the village.

“I thank you most humbly, good lady,” said the god.  “But before I depart, I have a warning for you.  Listen carefully: when you see yonder stone lion’s eyes turn scarlet, flee.  Flee for your life, for the great deluge will swiftly follow.  Flee and you shall be saved.”  With this, he disappeared into the mist, leaving the old woman shaken.
When she had recovered, she quickly got to her feet and thought very fast.  It was clear that the man was no beggar; indeed, he must have been a god.  It was clear to the old woman that the god’s warning was terribly important, and being the kind old soul she was, she hastened to spread the warning to everyone in the village.  And so she ventured down the path in the opposite direction as the god had come, and at each door she knocked, and to every villager she cried, “Heed this warning, for the gods have spoken: should you see the stone lion’s eyes turn red, flee!  Flee or the floods will come and take you with it!”
But the villagers, selfish and hateful people they were, only laughed.  They told the old woman that she was mad, and slammed the door in her face just as they had done to the god.  A few who had a particularly cruel streak in their nature attempted to pull the old woman’s leg.  “Does she really say that the floods will come if the stone lion’s eyes turn red?  Why, she’s as crazy as a donkey!”  In order to better humiliate her, these people surreptitiously took a bucket of red paint and a large paintbrush, and they painted the stone lions’ eyes a vivid scarlet.

When the old woman saw the red eyes, she screamed and yelled for everyone to run to higher ground.  “The floods are coming, the floods are coming!” she cried.  The miscreants who had painted the stone lion laughed at her in open mockery.  “The old loon fell for the trick!” they laughed, and everyone else laughed with them, for they had cruel and wicked souls.  In despair, the old woman gave up on the villagers and ran, alone, to higher ground.  And as she finally made her way atop a hill and stood, looking back at the village with its neatly lined houses, she was horrified to see a great torrent of water engulf it whole, rising and rising until not a single rooftop was visible.
A hundred years have passed since these events.  It is said that on the original site of the village none ever dared to set foot, for amid all the ruined houses the stone lion still stood – ravaged and worn, it is true, but still with these horrid, protuberant, scarlet eyes that the more superstitious have likened to the glare of a demon.  It is also said that the old woman lived to the grand old age of a hundred-and-one, and that she never had to worry for rice again.
